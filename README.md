# Basic Language Archive Metadata

> **Blam** The standard blasty noise. The power of the blam can sometimes be measured by the size of the word when it is written, or by the number of exclamation marks at the end of the word.

Basic Language Archive Metadata (BLAM) is designed to provide basic metadata for language repositories. The metadata scheme maximises discoverability and user oriented information without a proliferation of data fields and work for the data producer. Basic Language Archive Metadata is a suite of [CMDI](https://www.clarin.eu/content/component-metadata) profiles and currently consist of two pairs of profiles: 

* BLAM Bundle Repository: [documentation](#https://github.com/fxru/blam-metadata/blob/master/BLAMBundleRepository.md)
* BLAM Bundle User: documentation (to come)
* BLAM Collection Repository: documentation  (to come)
* BLAM Collection User: documentation  (to come)

BLAM is designed with a focus on discoverability and display. Data producers can submit additional metadata information to document their data and their research. The preferred format are other CMDI profiles or comparably standardized metadata formats.

The data fields of BLAM the profiles were defined to facilitate interoperability with metacatalogues, in particular [DataCite](https://search.datacite.org/), [OLAC](http://search.language-archives.org/), and [VLO](https://vlo.clarin.eu/).

* OLAC metadata: [specifications](http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/metadata.html), [usage](http://www.language-archives.org/NOTE/usage.html)
* DataCite Metadata: [Schema 4.0](https://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.0/)
* CLARIN VLO facets: [facets mapping](https://lux17.mpi.nl/isocat/clarin/vlo/mapping/index.html)

Recommended tools to create BLAM metadata are [CMDI Maker](http://cmdi-maker.uni-koeln.de/), [COMEDI](http://clarino.uib.no/comedi/), and [Arbil](https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/arbil/).

BLAM! &#x1F4A5; Thatâ€™s it, enjoy documenting your data!
